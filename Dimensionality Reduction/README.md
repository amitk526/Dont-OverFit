<h3> Dimensionality Reduction </h3>

These are few of the Dimensionality Reduction techinques that were employed to test the effectiveness in improving the accuracy of the predicted class labels after the selection of Logistic Regression as the final Classification Model and the Python Implementation for these can be found in the directories corresponding to their index numbers.

<ol>
<li> Principle Component Analysis (Accuracy : 649) </li>
<li> Singular Value Deconposition (Accuracy: 0.724) </li>
<li> Lasso Regression (Accuracy: 0.848) </li>
</ol>

Lasso Regression although heing a regularization technique can be be used for feature selection and dimensionality reduction as it has the tendency to eliminate the redundant features by assigning a zero value to the corresponding coefficient after regularization. This greatly improves the accuracy of out model as can be observed.
